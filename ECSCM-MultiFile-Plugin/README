           ECSCM-MultiFile: an ElectricSentry MultiFile Trigger

The ECSCM-MultiFile plugin is very similar to the standard ECSCM-File trigger,
except that the MultiFile trigger can be provided with a list of pathnames
(files and/or directories) to monitor, instead of just a single file.  Further,
the list may include wildcard characters in the same manner as one would use on
the command line (file globbing).

Install the jar file in the usual fashion: use the ectool installPlugin command,
or using the GUI, navigate to Administration->Plugins, select the "Install from
File/URL" tab, and install from there.  This will automatically create a new
Source Control configuration named "MultiFile".  When you create a new CI
schedule, you will find "MultiFile" in the dropdown list when defining the SCM
configuration to monitor.
