  <h2>Property Viewer Help</h2>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
     This plugin provides a PHP page to view and edit any property sheet in the
     system.  This is useful for quick access to property sheets for different
     objects throughout the system.  Some example scenarios:<br />
     <ul>
      <li>
       A project is commonly used to store all the build/test/deploy data and processes 
       for a given product.  A property sheet was created for each component for
       meta-data specific to that component.  Without the Property Viewer, a user clicks on
       the projects tab, then on the project, then on the properties tab, then on
       the "components" property sheet, and finally on the sheet for the component
       they're looking for.  Using the property viewer, the property sheets for each
       component can be easily accessed by storing links to them in a more visible
       location -- shortcuts on the home page, a list embedded in the description for
       the project, browser shortcuts, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
       A job step runs a set of tests and wants to make the data from the tests easily
       available to someone viewing the job.  They can store the data in a property
       sheet called "testResults" on the job step (using postp for example) and then
       create a link to Property Viewer for that sheet on the job summary (by storing it
       in /myJob/report-urls).  Multiple steps within the job may run different test suites
       and the data would be easily accessible via the Property Viewer links.
       </li>
     </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>Usage</h3>
  <p>
     The URL to the page is /commander/plugins/PropertyViewer.php.  Simply pass
     the path to the property sheet as the "path" parameter.  The tab and sub-tab
     are optionally set via parameters "s" and "ss" respectively.  Some examples:<br />
     <ul>
      <li>
       /commander/plugins/PropertyViewer.php?<b>path=/projects/MyProject/procedures/MyProcedure</b><i>&amp;s=Projects</i>
       -- Top-level properties for procedure "MyProcedure" in project "MyProject";
          displayed in the "Projects" tab
      </li>
      <li>
       /commander/plugins/PropertyViewer.php?<b>path=/resources/MyWorkspace/networking</b><i>&amp;s=Cloud&amp;ss=Workspaces</i>
       -- Nested property sheet "networking" for workspace "MyWorkspace";
          displayed in the "Cloud > Workspaces" tab
      </li>
      <li>
       /commander/plugins/PropertyViewer.php?<b>path=/jobs/build-1234</b><i>&amp;s=Jobs</i>
       -- Top-level properties for job "build-1234"; displayed in the "Jobs" tab
      </li>
      <li>
       /commander/plugins/PropertyViewer.php?<b>path=/server</b><i>&amp;s=Administration&amp;ss=Server</i>
       -- Top-level server properties; displayed in the "Administration > Server" tab
       (<a href="/commander/plugins/PropertyViewer/view.php?path=/server&amp;s=Administration&amp;ss=Server">View</a>)
      </li>
     </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>Example</h3>
  <p>
     This screenshot shows the Property Viewer for the nested sheet "components/server"
     stored on the project ProductABC.  The URL for this page is 
     /commander/plugins/PropertyViewer.php?<b>path=/projects/ProductABC/components/server</b><i>&amp;s=Projects</i>.
