OVERVIEW:

This plugin provides a PHP page to view and edit any property sheet in the system. This is useful for quick access to property sheets for different objects throughout the system. Some example scenarios:
* A project is commonly used to store all the build/test/deploy data and processes for a given product. A property sheet was created for each component for meta-data specific to that component. Without the Property Viewer, a user clicks on the projects tab, then on the project, then on the properties tab, then on the "components" property sheet, and finally on the sheet for the component they're looking for. Using the property viewer, the property sheets for each component can be easily accessed by storing links to them in a more visible location -- shortcuts on the home page, a list embedded in the description for the project, browser shortcuts, etc.
* A job step runs a set of tests and wants to make the data from the tests easily available to someone viewing the job. They can store the data in a property sheet called "testResults" on the job step (using postp for example) and then create a link to Property Viewer for that sheet on the job summary (by storing it in /myJob/report-urls). Multiple steps within the job may run different test suites and the data would be easily accessible via the Property Viewer links.

USAGE:

The URL to the page is /commander/plugins/PropertyViewer.php. Simply pass the path to the property sheet as the "path" parameter. The tab and sub-tab are optionally set via parameters "s" and "ss" respectively. Some examples:
* /commander/plugins/PropertyViewer.php?path=/projects/MyProject/procedures/MyProcedure&s=Projects -- Top-level properties for procedure "MyProcedure" in project "MyProject"; displayed in the "Projects" tab
* /commander/plugins/PropertyViewer.php?path=/resources/MyWorkspace/networking&s=Cloud&ss=Workspaces -- Nested property sheet "networking" for workspace "MyWorkspace"; displayed in the "Cloud > Workspaces" tab
* /commander/plugins/PropertyViewer.php?path=/jobs/build-1234&s=Jobs -- Top-level properties for job "build-1234"; displayed in the "Jobs" tab
* /commander/plugins/PropertyViewer.php?path=/server&s=Administration&ss=Server -- Top-level server properties; displayed in the "Administration > Server" tab
