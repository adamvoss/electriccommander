TASKS

- startup script that migrates counters
  - still make counters safe for uninstall + install

  > workspace
  > repository
  > test procedure that makes sure all of this works

BUGS

- diff should exclude project name (and export path), otherwise rolling back to
  a previous version with a different name will immediately yield pending changes

IMPROVEMENTS

- batch server requests as much as possible

- create GWT dashboard so it's usable in CDM UI; use popups instead of separate pages

FEATURES

- clone project (regular clone + version)

- email changes

- diff two versions of a project
  > mike's tool
