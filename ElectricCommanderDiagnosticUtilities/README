Summary
Following are instructions on how to use the various classes of “commander-logutil-jar-with-dependencies.jar” (jar file attached on this wiki page). The tool can be used to scan through and analyze a large set of uncompressed Commander server logs.

Prerequisite
Make sure that you have Java on path.

Command: ‘java -version’ to see if your system has it on path

Directory structure
For simplicity, make sure that commander-logutil-jar-with-dependencies.jar is in the directory that contains the directory with uncompressed logs.

The tool produces output to the same working directory

Example
C:\tools\commander-logutil-jar-with-dependencies.jar

C:\tools\logsToBeAnalyzed\<contains all uncompressed commander logs to be analyzed>

C:\tools\errors.txt (Output from running the tool against a set of logs)

ErrorLog Analyzer Example
Input: Directory containing commander.log files

Output: Creates errors.log in the working directory. errors.log will contain all the errors from all the commander logs in the input directory.

Use when: First level of triage, there is a problem and you need to look through the commander.logs to find it.

$ java -jar commander-logutil-jar-with-dependencies.jar logsToBeAnalyzed/
Sample output (errors.log)

2013-09-26T17:51:27.568 | ERROR | Api-005                        |    10149 |  1125391 | singleTransaction                             | OperationInvoker               | Operation exception: org.hibernate.QueryTimeoutException: Could not execute JDBC batch update

Request Analyzer Example
Inputs

-Class to use ( com.electriccloud.util.RequestAnalyzer )

-Directory containing commander.log files. Directory cannot be named 'logs'

Output

-requests directory (contains a breakdown of all request timings in each log file)

-commander.log in a logs directory (contains orphaned requests information)

Use when: The memory consumed by the commander server increases rapidly and you suspect a long running server request is the culprit. Or you want general statistics on what type of requests are coming in.

$ java -classpath commander-logutil-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.electriccloud.util.RequestAnalyzer logsToBeAnalyzed/
Sample output (logs/commander.log)

Use the 'requestContext[id=8420961' to find the actual request. Note the IP address. Is it a web server? Is it an agent? Is it an end user?
