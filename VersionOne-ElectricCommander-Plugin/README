This ElectricCommander Plugin was create by VersionOne.
Version: 1.0.112


The VersionOne ElectricCommander Notifier creates a record of ElectricCommander builds in VersionOne, so the development teams can associate stories and defects to a particular build. This visibility is useful when identifying problem builds or generating release notes.

Once the ElectricCommander Notifier has been installed, team members include a VersionOne identifier , such as “S-01454” or "TK-01234", in the comments of their SCM commit . Every time a build executes the Notifier creates a BuildRun asset in VersionOne with details of the build. If the build comment contains VersionOne Story or Defect Identifiers, the Notifier will create or reuse a VersionOne change-set and relate the build with the appropriate Story or Defect.

Using this integration you can better address the following situations: 

•Defects 
	•Which build the defect was reported against?
	•Which build contained the fix for the defect?
	•Which builds contain work for the defect?
•For Stories (Backlog Item) 
	•Which builds contain work for the story?
	•Which build contained the completed story?
•For Build Runs 
	•Which defects were fixed?
	•Which stories were completed?
	•Which defects were introduced?
	•When work for a story or defect was included?
	•Which Change-sets were included?
•For a range of Build Runs 
	•Which stories were completed?
	•Which defects were fixed?
	•Which defects were introduced?
