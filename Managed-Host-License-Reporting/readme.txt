Managed-Host-License-Reporting

This consists of two customer contributed scripts:

1. hostcount.pl - outputs a snapshot of the number of managed host licenses in use,
and the number of jobs/steps that are waiting for licenses.  Run this on a periodic data to characterize the license useage for that time.

2. GetLicWaitTime.pl - takes a date range as input and lists the jobs that waited during that time, and calculates the amound of time they spent waiting for a license, and percentage of time spent waiting for licenses.
