This project illustrates a few tricks that I've learned while developing
Electric Commander projects.  Some of the things illustrated are:

- How to create a template to be filled in with parameters/properties at
  run time
- How to test an input parameter for illegal entries
- How to automatically create property name/value pairs from step output
  when theses pairs are separated by a : or =

To install, go to the Administrtion > Plugin tab: Install From File/URL,
Browse to BagOfTricks_v<version>.jar, Upload, then Promote.  A project
called "Bag of Tricks" is created and has the procedures illustrating the
point above.

This project also includes a procedure for posting this project to Github.
It is configured to post to electriccommunity / electriccommander.  To use
this location, you will need write access.  Please feel free to add your
own examples to this project.
