This project illustrates a few tricks that I've learned while developing
Electric Commander projects.  Some of the things illustrated are:

- How to create a template to be filled in with parameters/properties at
  run time
- How to test an input parameter for illegal entries
- How to automatically create property name/value pairs from step output
  when theses pairs are separated by a : or =

To install, go to the Administrtion > Plugin tab: Install From File/URL,
Browse to BagOfTricks_1_0.jar, Upload, then Promote.  A project called
"Bag of Tricks-1.0" is created and has the procedures illustrating the
point above.
