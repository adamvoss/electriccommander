# What is this?

This is a collection of classes to make it easier to use the ElectricCommander 
Java SDK with Spring.

It has a ```@Configuration```-annotated class (```SDKConfiguration```) that 
provides all the beans necessary to fire up the SDK and talk to Commander.

#How do I use it?

See the ```SDKExample``` class for bootstraping and how to create beans that use the SDK.
