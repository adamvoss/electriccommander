This project provides a mechanism for automatically upgrading
ElectricAccelerator emake to the version stored on the Cluster Manager.

The perl script emakeConditionalUpgrade.pl queries the Cluster Manager for what
version of emake it contains and installs it on the machine where the perl
script is run if the local version is less than that on the Cluster Manager.
The script will then run emake using the arguments provided by the user.  The
script can be converted into an executable using the pp command.  If the
executable is called 'emake' or 'emake.exe', it should be put in the path in
an position before the ElectricAccelerator version of emake.  Example
executables have been included with this project.

For details on how to set up the Cluster Manager for this project, see:
ClusterManager Setup Instructions.txt
