Automatic emake Upgrade Program for Huawei

The emake upgrade program huaweiEmake, is to be used instead of the Electric
Accelerator emake command.  The upgrade program takes exactly the same arguments
as emake.  If a cluster manager is referenced in the command line arguments,
EMAKE_CM or EMAKEFLAGS environment variables, the program will compare the local
version of emake to that on the Cluster Manager.  If the local version is older
than that of the Cluster Manager, the program will download the emake binaries
from the Cluster Manager and install them locally.

Instructions on Use
-------------------
Run huaweiEmake in exactly the same manner that you would run emake

Options
-------
The script retrieves the installer files using HTTP.  The HTTP default port can be
overriden using the environment variable EA_HTTPPORT, for example

	set EA_HTTPPORT=81

to use port 81 instead of the default port 80.

The executable huaweiEmake name can be changed to emake, or other name if desired.

Executables
-----------
huaweiEmake - for Linux type machines (chmod +x huaweiEmake to make executable)
huaweiEmake.exe - for Windows machines

Assumptions
-----------
- emake is in the users PATH and not as an alias
- The Cluster Manager has been configured to respond to request from the executable
- User has write permissions to the directory bin (and lib in Linux) which contains
	emake referenced in the PATH environment variable
- The program huaweiEmake is in the user's PATH environment variable, but not in the
	emake installation path since this path may be overwritten by this program.
  
Known Issues
------------
- The program shows list of extracted files when running on Windows
- The program may generated symbolic link error when extracting the installer on Linux; these can be ignored
- The program generates a lot of errors if the user does not have write permissions to the emake bin
	(and lib in Linux) directories.
