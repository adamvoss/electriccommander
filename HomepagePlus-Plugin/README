HomepagePlus-Plugin README
==========================

Overview
--------

This is a plugin project for eclipse that builds against Commander SDK 2.0.  It
will not build with previous versions of the SDK.  The resulting plugin provides
a new home page that includes a workflow launcher and a workflow dashboard.

* Download or pull the project from github
* Import as a project into eclipse

* Create your .classpath file based on the provided sample-classpath file
* Build the project under eclipse
* Deploy the plugin to Commander via eclipse
* For production builds of this plugin:
  Edit *.gwt.xml files and delete browser and locale limits.  These limits
  have been specified in order to maximize development build speed.
  Files to edit:

    src/ecplugins/HomepagePlus/RunTaskWorkflow.gwt.xml
    src/ecplugins/HomepagePlus/HomeDashboard.gwt.xml

Notes
-----
The configuration panel is not functional for this plugin yet.  I will display
but serves no purpose.  The plugin does have parameters and they are stored in
/myUser/userSettings/workflowConfigurations.  Review project/ec_setup.pl for an
example of setting up workflowConfigurations given a project name, workflow
definition name and a starting state.

The sub tabs created via ec_setup.pl point to the WorkflowDashboard and
JobsDashboard plugins without checking that these plugins are installed.
